# Google Authenticator PHP Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate Google Authenticator with a PHP application for two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Prerequisites

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Composer
- Web server (Apache, Nginx, or PHP's built-in server)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-authenticator.git
cd google-authenticator
```

### 2. Install Composer

If Composer is not installed on your system, follow these steps:

# Download the Composer installer
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"

# Verify the installer (Optional but recommended)
php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === '<INSTALLER_HASH>') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"

# Run the installer
php composer-setup.php

# Remove the installer script
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

# Move Composer to a globally accessible directory
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

Replace `<INSTALLER_HASH>` with the latest hash found on the [Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command in the project directory to install the required dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

This command installs all the packages listed in `composer.json`, including `sonata-project/google-authenticator`.

## Project Structure

The project structure should look like this:

```
your_project/
│
├── vendor/                  # Composer dependencies
├── public/
│   └── index.php            # Main entry point
├── src/
│   └── TwoFactorAuth.php    # 2FA logic
├── composer.json            # Composer configuration
└── .htaccess                # Apache settings (if needed)
```

## Usage

1. Start the PHP built-in server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

3. You will see a page displaying a QR code. Scan this QR code with your Google Authenticator app.

4. Enter the OTP generated by the app into the input field and submit the form.

5. If the OTP is correct, you will receive a success message. Otherwise, you will see an error message.
