# Google Authenticator PHP Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate Google Authenticator with a PHP application for two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Prerequisites

- **PHP 7.4 or higher**
- **Composer**
- **Web server** (such as Apache, Nginx, or PHP's built-in server)

## Installation

### 1. Install PHP

If PHP is not installed on your system, you can download it from the [official PHP website](https://www.php.net/downloads) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Alternatively, you can install XAMPP, which includes PHP, Apache, and other useful tools.

#### **Installing XAMPP**

1. **Download XAMPP** from the [official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
2. **Install XAMPP** by following the instructions specific to your operating system.
3. **Start Apache Server** using the XAMPP control panel.

### 2. Install Composer

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. To install Composer, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Composer installer:**

    ```bash
    php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
    ```

2. **Verify the installer (Optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === '<INSTALLER_HASH>') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
    ```

   Replace `<INSTALLER_HASH>` with the latest hash from the [Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

3. **Run the installer:**

    ```bash
    php composer-setup.php
    ```

4. **Remove the installer script:**

    ```bash
    php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
    ```

5. **Move Composer to a globally accessible directory:**

    ```bash
    sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
    ```

### 3. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository from GitHub and navigate into the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitb0304/google-authenticator.git
cd google-authenticator
```

### 4. Install Project Dependencies

Run the following command in the project directory to install the required dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

This command installs all the packages listed in `composer.json`, including `sonata-project/google-authenticator`.

## Project Structure

The project structure should look like this:

```
your_project/
│
├── vendor/                  # Composer dependencies
├── public/
│   └── index.php            # Main entry point
├── src/
│   └── TwoFactorAuth.php    # 2FA logic
├── composer.json            # Composer configuration
└── .htaccess                # Apache settings (if needed)
```

## Usage

1. **Start the PHP built-in server:**

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public
   ```

2. **Open your web browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

3. You will see a page displaying a **QR code**. Scan this QR code with your Google Authenticator app.

4. Enter the **OTP (One Time Password)** generated by the app into the input field and submit the form.

5. If the OTP is correct, you will receive a success message. Otherwise, you will see an error message.
